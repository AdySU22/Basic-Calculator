# Basic-Calculator

This project is a comprehensive basic calculator implemented in C++. It supports various arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as advanced mathematical functions such as sine, cosine, tangent, square root, logarithm (base 10), natural logarithm, and exponential calculations. The calculator features a user-friendly interface that prompts users to enter calculations in a specific format. It also includes a history feature, implemented using a linked list, which allows users to store, retrieve, and manage the results of previous calculations. The project leverages the MathFunctions class to handle the mathematical computations and the Terms class to process and store individual calculation terms and results. Overall, this project showcases algorithmic thinking, efficient data structure usage, and robust error handling to provide a versatile and reliable calculation tool.
